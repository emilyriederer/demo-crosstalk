```

## Assessment 1

Consider a `penguins` data set with columns `r paste(names(penguins), collapse = ", ")`. 

Arrange the following code blocks in order to make two side-by-side scatterplots. The left plot should show bill length versus bill depth, and the second should show flipper_length versus flipper_depth. When any point is clicked, all data points for that species should be highlighted. 

```{r parsons}
question_parsons(
 initial = c(
  "data_ct <- SharedData$new(penguins, key = ~species)",
  "gg1 <- ggplot(data_ct, aes(bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, col = species)) + geom_point()",
  "gg2 <- ggplot(data_ct, aes(bill_length_mm, flipper_length_mm, col = species)) + geom_point()",
  "bscols(ggplotly(gg1), ggplotly(gg2))"
 ), 
 answer(c(
  "data_ct <- SharedData$new(penguins, key = ~species)",
  "gg1 <- ggplot(data_ct, aes(bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, col = species)) + geom_point()",
  "gg2 <- ggplot(data_ct, aes(bill_length_mm, flipper_length_mm, col = species)) + geom_point()",
  "bscols(ggplotly(gg1), ggplotly(gg2))"
 ),,
 correct = TRUE),
 allow_retry = TRUE,
 randow_answer_order = TRUE
)
```

## Assessment 2

Multiple choice mistakes:

1. Wrangle before casting
2. Pick correct `key`
3. Need to specify `group`
4, 

```{r add-function, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 5}
question("What number is the letter A in the English alphabet?",
  answer("8"),
  answer("14"),
  answer("1", correct = TRUE),
  answer("23")
)
```
